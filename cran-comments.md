## Resumbission in response to comments from Victoria Wimmer, 2023-04-25

* Removed \dontrun{} from most example code and made a few minor tweaks to ensure it
  runs in R CMD CHECK. Added \dontrun{} for example that took >5s.
* There are no references describing the methods yet, but we're using the methods
  in ongoing research and working on a few papers. We will add a reference as 
  soon as we have one.
